            <h2>Hi I'm Ranga</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my GitHub page. This is currently a work in progress. Over time I intend to complete various small projects I have been working on in my spare time, and port them over here to store in one central location. Lookout here for links to some Shiny apps I have developed (coming soon)</p>
